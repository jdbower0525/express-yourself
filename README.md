## TEXT MINER ##

The purpose of this program is the test the understand we've attained learning
about regular expressions.

First, you will have to install pytest to make sure the test program can apply
to the different programs that I've written.  After doing that, you'll be able
to run the test programs to make sure that the situations that I've set up
passes.

The tests have been written to ensure that, as the tests get progressively
more complex, that our understanding of regex has gotten far enough for us to
write code that will pass the tests.  

These tests are split into testing seperation by regex, extracting by regex,
and validating that words and numbers are defined correctly.
